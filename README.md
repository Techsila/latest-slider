# Latest Slider Widget
StreamElements overlay for showing events rotaion on streams.

Design and idea by Techsila. Mainly intended for my own use, so errors might occur on others people setup. If something weird is happening, PLEASE do tell me so that I can fix the errors. My discord is Techsila#3266 / https://discord.gg/gqB9guzcPc

Based on the widget: Events Rotator - Last Event Rotator By CO6STUDIOS

**How to set up**
1. Pick either the "image" or "video". They are all seperate widgets. In each folders there is a picture of each widget.
2. Make a new overlay. Set it to 1080p and the size to 1920 x 1080 and have no margin/padding to the sides.
3. Make a new custom widget.
4. Click the button "Open Editor"
5. Put the code in the fields. This project has different codes with different name, just like the widget: HTML / CSS / JS / Fields.
